# Email-Classification-with-TensorFlow

In this project we built an email classifier using neural networks. The purposes of the project are educative. The project focuses on fine-tuning hyperparameters for a base neural network and reduce variance on the development set.

We explain (not in depth) concepts like **Normalization**, **Batch Normalization**, **Dropout**, **learning rate** and **kernel initializer**. 

## Packages
Additionally to *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib* we used *scikit-learn*, *tensorflow* and *keras-tuner*.
